# Jokeapp

This Gem GETs 10 jokes from the Official Joke Api (https://github.com/15Dkatz/official_joke_api), asks for 
user input, provides a numbered list with the setups for 10 random jokes, and then asks the user to choose a setup that he/she would like to hear the punchline to. When the user inputs a number 1-10, the punchline for that joke is revealed. Then the program clears the jokes fetched from the API and starts over.

Press 1 to get the ten joke setups
Select a number from the list 1-10 and have a good laugh at the punchline!
